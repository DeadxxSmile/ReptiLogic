## ✨ Features

### 🐍 Collection
- Track animals with photos, morphs, weight, DOB, acquisition info, and notes
- **Auto-generated Animal IDs** (e.g. `BPF042-AhA`) or enter your own to match an existing system
- Grid and list view with filtering by species, sex, status, and search
- Full animal history — breeding records, weight log, feeding log, photo gallery
- Link parents at time of adding — lineage builds automatically over time
- Clickable **family tree** on the Lineage tab, going back as many generations as recorded
- Bulk import from CSV (Settings → Import)

### 🏥 Health
- Per-animal health dashboard with weight trend chart
- Log health issues with category and severity, track medications, record vet visits
- Dashboard reminders for animals overdue on feeding or weighing

### 🥚 Breeding
- Full pairing lifecycle: Planned → Active → Gravid → Laid → Hatched
- Terminology adapts for live-birth species (Born instead of Hatched, etc.)
- Log clutches with egg count, incubation details, and individual offspring records
- **Add Babies Wizard** — step through each hatchling, assign name/sex/weight/morphs/ID, add them all to your collection at once with parents auto-linked
- **Suggested Pairings** — scans your active collection and recommends pairings based on genetics

### 🧬 Genetics Calculator
- Full Punnett square engine: recessive, co-dominant, dominant, line-bred, and sex-linked
- **Allele complex support** — BEL complex (Lesser, Butter, Mojave, Phantom, Mystic, Russo, Special, Mocha), Yellow Belly complex, 8-Ball complex, Bearded Dragon Scale complex, and more. Two alleles from the same complex automatically produce the correct result (e.g. Lesser × Mojave = BEL)
- **Sex-linked Banana/Coral Glow** — Male Maker and Female Maker inheritance modelled correctly (~93% sex ratio skew). Maker type stored per animal and used automatically in From Collection mode
- Outcome cards showing morph name, probability, expected clutch count range, and sex ratio notes
- Clutch size projection based on species typical range
- Health warnings for all morphs with known concerns
- Use animals from your collection or enter genes manually

### 📖 Morph Library
- **Ball Python** — 130+ morphs with full allele groups, health concerns, sex-linked Banana/Coral Glow
- **Western Hognose** — 25+ morphs with corrected inheritance types (Anaconda = incomplete dominant, Toffee Belly = incomplete dominant, Lavender = recessive, Pastel RBE = dominant)
- **Leopard Gecko** — 18 morphs including all three non-allelic albino strains (Tremper, Bell, Rainwater), Mack Snow, Giant, Enigma and Lemon Frost with ethical health warnings
- **Bearded Dragon** — 14 morphs including Leatherback/Silkback (health flagged), Dunner, Zero, Witblits, American Smoothie
- Add custom morphs for any species — included in the calculator automatically

### 🖨️ Husbandry Print Reports
- Professional print-ready document from any animal's detail page
- Animal photo, morphs, 2-generation lineage pedigree, weight log, feeding history
- Breeder header with name, logo, website, and social links (Instagram, X, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook)

### 💾 Backup & Data
- Automatic compressed ZIP backups on app open or close, configurable retention and folder
- One-click restore from any saved backup
- Export collection, breeding records, and morphs to CSV
- CSV import with auto format detection

### ⚙️ Settings
- Breeder profile with logo and social links (used in print reports)
- Auto-generate or manual Animal IDs
- Light and dark mode
- Configurable feeding and weighing reminder thresholds
- Move database to any folder (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)

### 🧭 First-Run Wizard
5-step setup covering database location and automatic backup configuration. All settings adjustable later.
